### How to Get Free Pokéballs and PokéCoins in Pokémon Go

Pokéballs and PokeCoins are the backbone of your Pokémon Go experience. Pokéballs are essential for catching Pokémon, while PokeCoins help you purchase in-game items like Incubators, Lucky Eggs, and other essential tools. But what if you could get them for free? 

Thanks to Niantic's continuous updates and promotions, there are several methods available for trainers to earn these resources without having to spend a single cent. Here’s how you can get free Pokéballs and PokeCoins:

1. **Daily Free Pokéballs & PokeCoins from In-Game Rewards**

Every day, players can log into Pokémon Go and collect free rewards simply by completing daily tasks. You can receive Pokéballs, PokeCoins, and even rare items, depending on the event or time of year. Make sure to check the game every day to maximize your free rewards.

2. **PokéCoin Offers from Special Events**

Niantic frequently runs special events where players can earn bonus PokeCoins for completing specific tasks or challenges. Some events might offer PokeCoins as part of their limited-time objectives. Keep an eye out for these seasonal events to grab as many free PokeCoins as you can.

3. **Gym Battles and Raids for PokéCoins**

Another way to earn free PokeCoins is by defending gyms. If you place your Pokémon in a gym, you will earn PokeCoins over time based on how long your Pokémon stays in the gym. Raids also offer the opportunity to win Pokécoins through rewards and challenges, giving you an extra incentive to team up with other trainers.

4. **Leveling Up & Completing Achievements**

Every time you level up, you’ll be rewarded with items, including Pokéballs and PokeCoins. Additionally, by completing achievements in the game, such as catching a certain number of Pokémon or completing a set of tasks, you can earn free Pokéballs and PokeCoins. Always keep progressing to unlock these valuable items.

5. **Third-Party Apps and Websites Offering Free Resources**

There are also trusted third-party apps and websites where you can find daily updates on available promotions, giveaways, and offers for free Pokéballs and PokeCoins. Many of these sites work directly with Niantic to provide trainers with additional chances to earn resources. However, always be cautious and avoid any suspicious websites that could harm your account or violate game rules.

### Best Practices to Use Pokéballs and PokeCoins Effectively

Now that you have your free Pokéballs and PokeCoins, it’s important to use them wisely. Here are a few tips on how to get the most out of your resources:

- **Save Pokéballs for Rare Pokémon**: Use your Pokéballs strategically. While it’s tempting to throw them at every Pokémon you see, save them for rarer Pokémon or those in difficult-to-catch areas. This ensures that you don’t run out of Pokéballs while trying to catch a rare Pokémon that could add value to your collection.
  
- **Spend PokeCoins on Essential Items**: Use your PokeCoins to buy items that will enhance your gameplay. Some must-have items include Incubators for hatching eggs, Lucky Eggs for double XP during special events, and Premium Raid Passes for accessing exclusive raids.

- **Participate in Special Events**: Pokémon Go frequently hosts limited-time events where specific Pokémon appear more often or where you can earn bonus rewards. Use your Pokéballs to catch the special Pokémon, and spend your PokeCoins to acquire event-exclusive items.

- **Don’t Forget to Use Lures**: Lures can attract wild Pokémon to your location for 30 minutes. It’s a smart idea to use your Pokéballs during these times to maximize your catches. This is especially useful if you are trying to complete a special event or research task.

### What’s New in Pokémon Go in 2025?
